module checks where
  -- these three judmgements lift the action semantics judgements to relate
  -- an expression and a list of pair-wise composable actions to the
  -- expression that's produced by tracing through the action semantics for
  -- each element in that list.
  --
  -- we do this just by appealing to the original judgement with
  -- constraints on the terms to enforce composability.
  --
  -- in all three cases, we assert that the empty list of actions
  -- constitutes a reflexivity step, so when you run out of actions to
  -- preform you have to be where you wanted to be.
  --
  -- note that the only difference between the types for each judgement and
  -- the original action semantics is that the action is now a list of
  -- actions.

  -- the following collection of lemmas asserts that the various runs
  -- interoperate nicely. in many cases, these amount to observing
  -- something like congruence: if a subterm is related to something by one
  -- of the judgements, it can be replaced by the thing to which it is
  -- related in a larger context without disrupting that larger
  -- context.
  --
  -- taken together, this is a little messier than a proper congruence,
  -- because the action semantics demand well-typedness at each step, and
  -- therefore there are enough premises to each lemma to supply to the
  -- action semantics rules.
  --
  -- therefore, these amount to a checksum on the zipper actions under the
  -- lifing of the action semantics to the list monoid.
  --
  -- they only check the zipper actions they happen to be include, however,
  -- which is driven by the particular lists we use in the proofs of
  -- contructability and reachability, which may or may not be all of
  -- them. additionally, the lemmas given here are what is needed for these
  -- proofs, not anything that's more general.
